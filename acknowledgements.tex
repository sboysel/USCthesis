First and foremost, I am deeply indebted to my advisor Matthew Kahn, whose
support and guidance throughout my academic career has been second to none. I am
also grateful for the detailed feedback on this work provided by my dissertation
committee members David Kempke, Paulina Oliva, and Robert Metcalfe.  I
appreciate the work my committee has done in providing high-level insight,
catching errors or problems, and suggesting strategies to achieve my research
objectives. Additionally, I thank Shane Greenstein for his thorough review of
early iterations of my work. Moreover, conversations with Professors Cheng
Hsiao, Jeff Weaver, Vittorio Bassi, Monica Morlacco, and Geert Ridder helped
refine my thought process and methodology. I'd like to also thank the unyielding
support of Young Miller and Annie Le, whose tireless efforts within the USC
economics department too often go without proper acknowledgement.

Finally, comments from colleagues Rajat Kochar, Ruozi Song, Nicolas Roig, Karim
Fajury, Thomas Ash, Islamul Haque, Amy Mahler, Yue Fang, Liying Yang, Xiongfei
Li, Taraq Khan, and Amanda Ang have all helped shaped my research in positive
directions. More importantly, I cherish their friendship in ways that transcend
research.
